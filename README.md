Hello Mr TA.
To run this program you will have to use my Makefile
I have prepared four runs for you. They run on windows cmdlets.
To compile and build the code run (make mainw) in the console.
To run the code choose from these four options.
1. make gow1 (Runs the code with only an age as the agument. The age is sat to 15 you can)
2. make gow2 (args will be "15 people-with-age.csv")
3. make gow3 (agrs will be "15 people-with-age.csv out.csv")
4. make gow4 (args will be "15 stdin out2.csv". This one is a little fun because its not really a part of the assignment, but anyways i thought that it was missing to write to the stdin and output to a file)
Feel free to just compile and run the code however you want. but these 4 will show the completeness of the program.

The program is about reading from a stream. either a stream in form of a file or the stdin-out streams. Then taking whatever is in the stream and tokenize it into a namestring and agestring.
then further prossecing of the validity of the age and if its input after a comma"," if the conditions is not met. Errors will pop up in the stderr.
